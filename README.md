# Uber Price Prediction

Developed a system which can predict the future price of Uber based on the date, time, start and end location using Haversine Formula.

Implemented a script in C# .Net to automate the mining process for collecting the price using Uber API.

Collected and stored the dataset in the MongoDB Database.

Pre-Processed dataset and applied Linear Regression using R to predict the future price based on the input from the user.

Created a web dashboard to show the results after predicting and analysis in the form of graphs using AngularJS.

Integrated R into web app using OpenCPU JavaScript library to execute the R Script asynchronously.
