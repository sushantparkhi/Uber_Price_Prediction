# Ride Scanner

Developed a responsive web application which shows the price comparison between taxi services Uber and Lyft with turn by turn direction.

Applied Uber and Lyft REST API to get the price data and Google Places API to get the turn by turn direction and nearby places. 

Implemented a Price Comparison Algorithm which shows the lowest price available for the userâ€™s current location and destination.
